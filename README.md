# Pandemic Manager for University
## Description

The project aims to provide a website for University members to manage pandemic precautions. The project will help managing HES codes and the vaccine status of university members. 

- Managing HES codes/ Vaccine & PCR status  
The website will store the HES codes, PCR & Vaccine statuses of users.
Users will be able to update their HES code.
The Vaccination and PCR information will be updated automatically by the system if applicable. If not, users will be asked to provide this information manually.

- Keeping Track of Quarantine Status  
The system will keep track of the quarantine information of users. This status will be used to notify corresponding staff such as instructors, activity organizers and dormitory administration.

- Contact Tracing  
If a user is infected, he/she will not be allowed on campus until his/her quarantine period is over. If the user has contacted an infected person, he/she will be notified and asked to get a PCR or Diagnovir test. The determination of contact will be inferred from two methods. One of them is based on the classroom seating plan and optional contact list data obtained from the user. Other one is based on automated tracing to find possible contact using dormitory data or the participant data. Dormitory data will be used to identify the roommates of the user, participant data will be used for attendance of some university activities such as club meetings, seminars, and concerts. 

- Online Reservation System for Indoor Facilities  
The website will also provide an appointment system for indoor facilities such as sports halls that have capacity limitations. Although the University already has an existing  appointment system, the main reason the project will have this feature is that current reservations in sports halls are taken manually via calls made to the sports hall personnel. This leads to an inefficient process where users cannot make reservations when another person is on the line of the phone or the staff in the sports hall is occupied with another person in the sports hall. The appointment system on the website will provide an interface where empty time slots in the sports hall are shown to the users and they can make reservations just by selecting the slot they want. Moreover, the system will also provide the ease of cancelling a reservation without the requirement of contacting the staff on the phone in case of an inconvenient situation. The appointment system will be available only for users whose HES code is not in a risky situation.

- Daily Covid Case Statistics  
The website will have a part for Covid Case Statistics. Covid related statistics will be shared at this part.

- User notification system  
Users will send an e-form to the university administration about possible problems he/she encounters such as missing disinfectant in buildings, missing hygiene products in toilets.
